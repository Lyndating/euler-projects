# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
# 1**2 + 2**2 +...+10**2 = 385

# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# (1+2+...+10)**2 = 55*2 = 3025

# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 
# 3025âˆ’385=2640.

# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
